# First-boot bootstrap for the video-production pipeline.
#
# Ported from the add-on's s6 oneshot. Three constraints carried over verbatim,
# because each one was a bug once:
#   1. Idempotent — guarded by a sentinel on the PVC; later boots exit in ms.
#   2. Non-fatal — a failed install must never stop pi-web from serving. Every
#      failure path exits 0 after logging.
#   3. Persistent — everything lands under the PVC, so an image bump does not
#      re-download 720MB.
